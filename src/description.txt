Description of files in /src folder

1. generate_key.cpp: Generates key using the mt19937 generator.

2. matrixvecmul.cpp: 
-Perform the matrix vector multiplication.
-Code written in March and april 2020.
-It is the first implementation of matrix vector computation and scale upto 256 bits. 
-Individual bits are stored in int array and packed into integer of word 64 bits.

3.optmatvec.cpp: 
-Optimized version of matrix vector multiplication. 
-The main function computed 1M times takes around 600 ms. 
-Bitwise operation is used and finally the mod-3 value is calculated.


4.phase3.cpp: 
-Phase three of the PRF project. 
A 81X256 matrix in Z3 is multiplied by 256 bits we received from previous phase. 
According to Yuval, since this matrix will be public, we can use toeplitz to generate this matrix.
